## Wish List

* git wrapping commands
* angular generators (projects, components)
* react generators (projects, components)

gn generate
gn scaffold
gn version
gn env
gn init (git, npm, etc.)

it would be awesome if the commands could respond to the current environment
maybe files could have a gn.json (orient.json, context.json, con.txt) file in the root or a config folder which tells the cli what kind of env to use.

keep a master list of sites on the machine

this could be a replacement to excel sheets. Just interact by text, work on ai responses. This could be the testing ground for germ and mise.

gn init

git init
create a readme, sync to github
if static push to github pages
if not static create a heroku, sync
- need: name of project, boilerplate to serve

When using the cli, search for a context file in the current directory, if not there, search child directories, if not there, search parent directories. Tell the user where it was found if not the current directory.

con.txt files

Project Name
Framework
